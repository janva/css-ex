                Batman’s fame came from his comic Batman released in 1940, but
                he first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Dick Grayson
                is the real name of Batman’s right hand man, Robin. He didn’t
                actually hit the Gotham-based comic world until Issue #38.
